# Youfy

Youfy is a simple Python project that will gather your YouTube playlist content and in a dummy way will try to convert it to Spotify playlist.
This script is based on [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/) and [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy). Big thanks to [Micha≈Ç](https://github.com/Ernold11) for his contribution!
